        <h4></h4>
        <p>Here we are at the end of another year, and as tradition now dictates, that means it’s time for the “Best Of And Finally…” issue!</p>

<p>There’s no double-anonymized voting system going on with how I picked this “best of“. I just opened up every issue of the newsletter I published during 2023, read the “And Finally…” links, and judged each by the metric of “Which links still make me smile?” Science! 🔬</p>

<p>I hope your 2023 has been full of happiness and prosperity, and I wish you all the best for 2024. 🎊 Enjoy the links, and I hope a few make you smile, too! I’ll be back next week with a regular issue.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>2023 has been a fantastic year for me in many ways. This newsletter continues to do well, which is constantly surprising, and <a href="https://cur.at/W0z28ea?m=rss">the Swift Package Index received support from Apple</a> and continues to grow beyond all expectations. Yet, I feel melancholy as we approach the end of 2023.</p>

<p>I hope you’re not feeling the same way I am, but just in case you are, it’s worth a reminder, and I say this primarily to myself: Breaks from work are essential.</p>

<p>I’m terrible at taking breaks. When I worked for someone else, I always ended the year with spare vacation days as December ended, and that problem only got worse when I started working for myself. It’s not that I never take a day off, but needing to send this newsletter every Friday means I can never switch off for a whole week, which maintains a relatively consistent level of background stress throughout the year. I don’t mean to complain. I know I’m lucky to be in this situation, and there are many jobs with far higher stress, but it doesn’t change the fact that I feel exhausted.</p>

<p>So, I’m going to try to switch off as much as possible for the next two weeks and focus on the positive things that happened this year. I’ll put together the “Best of And Finally…” edition that you’ll receive next Friday as soon as I’ve sent out this issue, and that’s the newsletter done until the new year! I’ll also take as much time as possible off from the package index, and even though I have an idea for a little experiment in the documentation hosting system I’d love to prototype in a few spare days, I think it needs to wait.</p>

<p>Thank you all so much for continuing to read my words here during 2023, for writing all of the blog posts and articles I link to, and for the feedback and kind words you send in replies. I also hope that, wherever possible, you can also take a break over the holidays.</p>

<p>I’ll be back at full capacity, refreshed and ready to go on the 5th of January, and I can’t wait to see what 2024 brings!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QKQDsE9?m=rss">Get your apps ready for the holidays</a></h4>
        <p>It has been this way <a href="https://cur.at/HV4btbE?m=rss">since 2021</a>, but it’s always nice to remember that you no longer need to plan ahead if you want to change something in App Store Connect or submit a new app update. Just don’t forget what I said about taking breaks, though! Just because you <em>can</em> log in every day during the holidays doesn’t mean you <em>should</em>! 😂</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/d1kJBxm?m=rss">Plain Swift - a simple Swift IDE for Windows</a></h4>
        <p>I’ve linked to a few <a href="https://cur.at/YqYahQX?m=rss">articles covering Swift on Windows recently</a>, so I was interested to see Dmitry Kozhinov talk about his Swift editor for Windows <a href="https://cur.at/wwXEbHh?m=rss">in the Community Showcase forum</a>. I was also surprised to learn that it’s been around for well over a year, and while it has some limits, such as a lack of support for SwiftPM, this is worth a look if you’re interested in Swift on Windows.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/MN1oSaG?m=rss">Xcode does not have access to your shell environment</a></h4>
        <p>This post from <a href="https://cur.at/vqkZwyp?m=rss">Jesse Squires</a> is a helpful reminder that Xcode can’t access your environment, but there’s one more thing I would have added to the post that I’ll mention here. Don’t forget you can still set environment variables from your project’s scheme configuration. Edit your scheme from the Product menu, select the Arguments tab against the Run behaviour, and set Environment Variables. 👍</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/YwY20vn?m=rss">Transferable drag &amp; drop on macOS</a></h4>
        <p>I’m sure I remember reading the same point that <a href="https://cur.at/DYQz8tv?m=rss">Mathijs Kadijk</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/veShxmE?m=rss">Tom Lokhorst</a> make in this post, but in a blog post about an AppKit implementation some years ago, but I don’t remember who wrote it. It turns out that there are some things you’ll want to know when implementing macOS drag and drop with SwiftUI, too!</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/YwY20vn?m=rss">nonstrict.eu</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/lNatyGj?m=rss">Should you add final to all your Swift classes?</a></h4>
        <p>I’d imagine that at some point while using Swift, someone you’ve talked with will have brought up the idea of just marking <em>all</em> class definitions as final. <a href="https://cur.at/IJjHQX4?m=rss">Junda Ong</a> writes about where you might just be making work for yourself.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/QwcN0Fo?m=rss">Decoupled stacked sheet navigation with multiple modals</a></h4>
        <p>You probably don’t want to overuse “sheets” for <em>too</em> much of your UI, but there are valid cases where you might want to present one sheet from another, and you find SwiftUI trying to discourage you with an error message. <a href="https://cur.at/3IWZhZH?m=rss">Martin Pfundmair</a> digs into how to make things a little easier with the help of the <a href="https://cur.at/iJdxMrn?m=rss">Ice Cubes open-source code</a>.</p>

        <p>Talking of <a href="https://cur.at/EWMjGV?m=rss">Ice Cubes</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/EgZzmjn?m=rss">Thomas Ricouard</a> recently used OpenAI’s vision APIs to generate image descriptions and wrote up how (and why!) he approached the problem, and it’s worth a read.</p>

      <h3>Design</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/bJL3ABn?m=rss">Design tool canvas handles</a></h4>
        <p>How hard can it be to design the “handles” that are common in apps that let users position and transform boxes or other shapes on a canvas? Like most design problems, it can be very tricky once you look beyond the basics. Let <a href="https://cur.at/vtMS8zN?m=rss">Marc Edwards</a> take you through some of the decisions behind designing this kind of feature well.</p>

      <title>iOS Dev Weekly - Issue 639 - Dec 8th 2023</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>You’ll almost certainly have seen links to the <a href="https://cur.at/mo9uCgi?m=rss">new mlx repository</a> during this week. It’s a new project from a <a href="https://cur.at/nxxdBcB?m=rss">machine learning research group inside Apple</a>, so it makes sense that the repository description is “An array framework for Apple silicon”. That’s certainly a description written by a research group rather than a marketing department, especially when you look into what it does.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://cur.at/L93LPI4?m=rss">examples repository</a> shows more of what it’s capable of, with samples covering <a href="https://cur.at/kAxEb7?m=rss">transformer language models</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/GK2ehSf?m=rss">LLaMA</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/nirLCQg?m=rss">LoRA</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/vrPBq3n?m=rss">Stable Diffusion</a>, and <a href="https://cur.at/xdUoj5G?m=rss">OpenAI’s Whisper</a>. There’s also a <a href="https://cur.at/gcrQnlj?m=rss">quick start guide</a> and more <a href="https://cur.at/jsuzP27?m=rss">documentation</a> if you want to explore further.</p>

<p>Why is this significant? We have all those things already, right? We do, but think about how and where Apple likes to do most of its AI processing: On-device.</p>

<p>This library is optimised for Apple Silicon chips, and speeding up AI models on the devices we have in our pockets, on our wrists, in our ears, on our desks, and coming soon to our faces is essential if Apple wants to continue processing most data locally. It isn’t how other companies approach AI, but it makes perfect sense that it would be how Apple looks at it, given their history and marketing around privacy.</p>

<p>I know nothing about Apple’s plans, but it makes a lot of sense that whatever they do will be primarily (or entirely) on-device, and this repository is one clue that this remains important to them. 🕵️</p>

        <p>When <a href="https://cur.at/J7Taq9P?m=rss">Xcode Cloud</a> first <a href="https://cur.at/QuTutWt?m=rss">launched</a>, Apple promised 25 hours per month of free usage until the end of 2023. It’s December, so you might have been expecting a bill or started making alternative arrangements, but there’s no need for either! What started as an introductory offer is now the free tier for Xcode Cloud. That’s good news by anyone’s standards!</p>

        <p>It’s nice that Mac apps have a standard “About” box that automatically picks up the version, build number, app name, and icon. But if you want to do more (no, not <a href="https://cur.at/XQAOkt9?m=rss">this much</a>), do you need to start from scratch? <a href="https://cur.at/6FbIwKT?m=rss">Daniel Saidi</a> shows us how to customise rather than replace.</p>

It’s a short post covering how he used <a href="https://cur.at/tGfqjI8?m=rss">Atomics</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/tkudw99?m=rss">ManagedAtomic</a> from <a href="https://cur.at/GJqYx0l?m=rss">swift-atomics</a> to tame PhotoKit.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>It’s thrilling for any app developer when Apple shines their light your way. It’s great to find something you worked on in an editorial list, or even better if your app is lucky enough to be picked as “App of the Day”. 😍 But I’d imagine nothing compares to winning an Apple Design Award or <a href="https://cur.at/a6m2AlO?m=rss">being picked as an App Store Award winner</a>, though, and this week, Apple shined its light brightly on 15 winners across apps, games, and projects with cultural impact.</p>

<p>I always like to try a selection of the apps that win these awards. Not only are they usually worthwhile and well-made apps, but if you’ve even half an eye on one day being considered to win one, it’s a great idea to look at what Apple values when picking winners.</p>

<p>Look at all this year’s winning apps, and you’ll find clean and uncluttered designs primarily using standard UI. It’s always a good idea to integrate new operating system features or this year’s hot new device hardware feature if it makes sense, but look specifically at the UI of <a href="https://cur.at/rYu3QkK?m=rss">AllTrails</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/ByHCHHO?m=rss">Photomator</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/faJUHBR?m=rss">SmartGym</a>, and <a href="https://cur.at/apkfFs8?m=rss">Too Good To Go</a>. They are all well-designed, of course, but look at how simple and “standard” their UI is. Each of them fits perfectly into their platform. That’s far from Apple’s only criteria for these awards, but it’s something that I see happen every year.</p>

<p>That’s not to say that the apps that move further away from “standard” platform UI are being (or should be) punished for it. There are many good reasons to do that, especially with apps like <a href="https://cur.at/kolq0vo?m=rss">Proloquo</a>, where familiarity with a <em>different</em> set of standard icons and concepts is far more critical. Either way, UI “fit” is fundamental.</p>

<p>Anyway, congratulations to all <a href="https://cur.at/3jpLQoU?m=rss">the finalists</a> and, of course, <a href="https://cur.at/a6m2AlO?m=rss">the winners</a>!</p>

<p>I think it’s likely that we’ll see these awards expand to <a href="https://cur.at/fIN3Gr0?m=rss">another platform</a> next year. Will your app be the first App Store Award winner on visionOS?</p>

        <p>It has only been <a href="https://cur.at/eqOAl9S?m=rss">a few weeks</a> since <a href="https://cur.at/ZuiT63v?m=rss">Alexandre Colucci</a> covered <a href="https://cur.at/nONCBHS?m=rss">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS 17</a>, and here he is again with the same stats from Sonoma. It’s interesting to see Swift in the secure enclave and that Objective-C is going nowhere. It’s also notable that Mac Catalyst usage started to decrease this year, and SwiftUI is almost ready to swap places with it. Fascinating stuff.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/eSFazcl?m=rss">Using on-demand resources</a></h4>
        <p>I had <em>no idea</em> that the “on-demand resources” that <a href="https://cur.at/PyGXGDg?m=rss">Toomas Vahter</a> talks about in this article were a thing. If you want a reason to click through, this is how to store something like an API key more securely than just embedding it in your code. My mind has been blown! 🤯</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/narbMUT?m=rss">Gestures in SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose</a></h4>
        <p>Are you curious about Jetpack Compose for Android? I liked the idea of this pair of articles from Chase Lewis. The one linked above implements some standard gestures in SwiftUI, and <a href="https://cur.at/RvwgcoC?m=rss">this article shows the same gestures implemented with Jetpack Compose</a>. It’s not so scary when you look at them side-by-side. 👍</p>

        <p>I enjoyed this post from Matteo Altobello and <a href="https://cur.at/ZixHXiM?m=rss">Tiago Gomes Pereira</a>, where they look at both triggering integrated USDZ animations and animating the models in space using RealityKit. It’s one to pay attention to if you’re thinking about visionOS.</p>

        <p>I wanted to love the magazines on Apple News+, but <a href="https://cur.at/3H3PYUT?m=rss">Sahand Nayebaziz</a> is right that it’s hard to love. We’re four years in, and non-retina images and clunky navigation still prevail.

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>The two stories in <a href="https://cur.at/kkGNV8M?m=rss">this Apple Developer News post</a> set me thinking about how visionOS brings new interaction and UI problems to solve with shared and collaborative user interfaces.</p>

<p>Most of the devices we use today are designed to be operated by one person. Yes, we sometimes gather physically around a screen or in a conference room with a projector, but one person is almost always in control.</p>

<p>That's the same for a headset, of course, but the Vision Pro is about to move user interfaces into the real world, which is very much a shared space! If we bring AR visualisations like the ones shown in the examples I linked to above, part of the benefit of those visualisations will be collaborating around them, but questions quickly arise when several people get involved.</p>

<p>Imagine walking around that <a href="https://cur.at/194h6nS?m=rss">model of the Formula 1 car</a> while another person watches you walk straight through <em>their</em> version of the same 3D model because no headset knows where other headsets have positioned everything. Shared UI state will be critically important as soon as you have a second AR device in the same room, and even more so in a future where <em>everyone</em> might one day wear lightweight AR glasses. Add animation or interaction to the visualisation, and that state synchronisation becomes even more important.</p>

<p>But it goes even further than that. Do you also need to share the position of the UI window that contains the parameters to control the airflow simulation? Or will that mean people are bumping into each other to make adjustments? Then, how will you choose whose inputs “win” if two people change the same parameter simultaneously? Or do people get their own controls and simulations to tweak without interrupting others? Will voice control provide a better experience instead? There are so many questions to answer and assumptions we’ll make based on how we interact with physical objects in the real world.</p>

<p>In the meantime, all the technology we need to make the underlying architecture for this shared state already exists. As mentioned in <a href="https://cur.at/w3hReSV?m=rss">the PTO article</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/O9D36Eg?m=rss">SharePlay</a> can help, and for devices close to each other, we also have <a href="https://cur.at/lJ6p5Ls?m=rss">Multipeer Connectivity</a>.</p>

<p>It might be time to break out the <a href="https://cur.at/ZOmbbym?m=rss">Creating a Multiuser AR Experience</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/M7oYLrK?m=rss">SwiftShot</a> sample code projects again!</p>

        <p>Last week, I linked to <a href="https://cur.at/I4szWpA?m=rss">Paul Hudson’s new resources on using Metal shaders in SwiftUI</a>, and this week, I noticed a new package in the index written by <a href="https://cur.at/FEFjXNr?m=rss">Dale Price</a> that uses Metal to apply variable blurs to SwiftUI views. I’m not saying the two things are related, but there seems to be some interest in this new SwiftUI functionality.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>Did you watch the <a href="https://cur.at/VCDSUOu?m=rss">GitHub Universe keynote</a> earlier this week? Or should I say, the GitHub CoPilot keynote?</p>

<p>I won’t talk about the state of AI, the CoPilot technology itself, or any <a href="https://cur.at/Lq2hsBV?m=rss">other potential issues</a> in my comment today. All of that will change over time, and no matter where my opinion would land, I want to save my inbox. 😬 Instead, I want to talk about it more broadly.</p>

<p>GitHub is clearly all in on CoPilot, and to prove that point, it was the focus of their <em>entire</em> keynote. CoPilot in Pull Requests, generating descriptions and explaining code. CoPilot in editors and IDEs, both first-party and expanding out into third-party too. CoPilot everywhere.</p>

<p>Then, as the keynote closed, they previewed “<a href="https://cur.at/cQbw5fC?m=rss">CoPilot Workspace</a>”, and it’s an evolution of CoPilot across the full software development process. Open a GitHub issue, describe your problem, go back and forth with the AI to define and edit a spec, then hit a button and have it open a Pull Request with the code and tests implemented. Magic! 🧞</p>

<p>Recently, I’ve received several quite pessimistic emails that focus on what might happen as this technology matures and becomes capable of things like CoPilot Workspace. What will all the software developers do once we’re out of work? 😱</p>

<p>AI brings the potential for massive change in software development, and there’s a good chance it’ll meaningfully change the industry. I’m not pessimistic about it, though. We’ve been through big changes before, and so has almost every other industry. It’s progress, and if AI doesn’t drive it, something else will.</p>

<p>If we do end up in a world where we can write a GitHub issue, press a button, and see a perfect change get deployed, it’ll mean we have to get <em>much</em> better at writing issues, and we’ve been fighting that battle for decades! If this is what makes that happen, bring it on. 😂</p>

<p>Seriously, though, this is a fantastic video that takes a genuinely approachable look at Metal fragment shaders for someone without prior Metal knowledge. Even better, it’s accompanied by a <a href="https://cur.at/jXQq5EH?m=rss">blog post</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/uCzPN5M?m=rss">GitHub repository</a> with possibly the <a href="https://cur.at/KeXR5CP?m=rss">best README file</a> I’ve ever seen.

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>This year’s <a href="https://cur.at/3LTSFEG?m=rss">Swift Mentorship Program</a> just wrapped up, and I’m happy to say that it’s now the third year I have participated as a mentor for the <a href="https://cur.at/y3MJSd6?m=rss">Swift Package Index project</a>. It’s something I really enjoy doing, and it is a great opportunity to show that open-source work isn’t as scary as it might seem.</p>

<p>This year, I worked with <a href="https://cur.at/QfA6hbx?m=rss">Cyndi Chin</a>, and one of her goals was to work on a feature from start to finish. As we chatted about what that meant, we landed on it covering everything from designing the feature through implementing it on both the front and back end, and finally, writing the feature launch blog post! When Cyndi says “start to finish”, she means it. 😱</p>

<p>The feature that Cyndi designed and shipped is for package authors rather than people looking for packages. It makes the package score that partially affects the order of search results transparent and visible and adds two more score metrics, which is something I’ve wished we had for a long time. I won’t go into detail here, as you should read Cyndi’s <a href="https://cur.at/QQy0wo3?m=rss">launch post on the Swift Package Index blog</a> instead.</p>

<p>Working with Cyndi was an absolute pleasure, and what she achieved over the last 12 weeks is a valuable step forward for the Swift Package Index. Thank you Cyndi!</p>

<p>I’d also like to recommend that if you’re involved with any Swift open-source project and haven’t yet participated in the Swift Mentorship Program, you keep an eye on the <a href="https://cur.at/jPopuJt?m=rss">swiftmentorship tag on the Swift Forums</a>. The programme usually gets announced in July. 🚀</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/gZrj6p7?m=rss">Progress toward the Swift 6 language mode</a></h4>
        <p>It has been a while since we’ve heard anything about Swift 6, but that changed earlier this week when <a href="https://cur.at/sccaA5s?m=rss">Holly Borla</a> announced a narrowing of scope to focus on data-race safety in the upcoming major version. The pace of features in the 5.x releases has been a little overwhelming, so I’m not sad to hear this!</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/Nox2rjZ?m=rss">Missing Xcode run test buttons</a></h4>
        <p>I would love this bug to be fixed, but until that happens, I’m glad to have this workaround from <a href="https://cur.at/mHmuHVO?m=rss">Paul Samuels</a>. I have also noticed a similar bug where sometimes the test buttons are there but do nothing when clicked, and ⌘⌥⇧U no longer runs the currently focused test.</p>

        <p>I was so happy to see all these colour utility methods come to iOS and friends with this year’s releases. Thanks to <a href="https://cur.at/dcXaFCb?m=rss">Natalia Panferova</a> for writing up a quick guide on them!</p>

        <p>This is an interesting idea from <a href="https://cur.at/1OHmBnS?m=rss">James Swiney</a>. I love how the particles transition out of the “screen”, but I also wonder what it would look like with pixel art in the window and more realistic effects outside it. 🤔</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>You might have noticed a couple of changes to <a href="https://cur.at/8XLBOVl?m=rss">the Swift website</a> recently. First, a long-running project from the <a href="https://cur.at/zX3fVpU?m=rss">Swift Website Workgroup</a>¹ went live with a significant content update. The old home page introduction paragraph is gone, replaced with code snippets to give a sense of the language, new <a href="https://cur.at/OJXs5if?m=rss">getting started</a> resources, an improved <a href="https://cur.at/FkyVQpT?m=rss">installation page</a>, several new guides covering <a href="https://cur.at/FnI3sMf?m=rss">creating a command line tool</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/qNtGDoM?m=rss">Swift on the server</a>, <a href="https://cur.at/moW4nxr?m=rss">newly written articles</a>, and <a href="https://cur.at/hHMt1WC?m=rss">many more improvements</a>.</p>

<p>Then, yesterday, <a href="https://cur.at/C2QW7Bp?m=rss">we added</a> a new <a href="https://cur.at/F9tIy1p?m=rss">Packages page</a> that showcases a selection of packages from across the Swift package ecosystem.</p>

<p>For me, the most exciting part of this page is the <a href="https://cur.at/sZnRYw9?m=rss">Community Showcase</a>, which we will update monthly with community-nominated packages. The first showcase highlights some packages recently discussed on Swift-related podcasts, but the doors are open for nominations of packages from all over the community. The only restriction is that you must nominate someone else’s package, not one you are involved with maintaining. You can make nominations in <a href="https://cur.at/GdiAl9p?m=rss">this thread on the Swift forums</a>, and I can’t wait to see what we feature over the coming months.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more potential for improvements to the website, but I hope you’ll agree² that these two updates are a significant step forward.</p>

<p>¹ For full disclosure, I am a member of this workgroup.<br/>
² Again, please remember that I am biased, being involved with both the Swift Website Workgroup and the Swift Package Index, which powers the packages page.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>When we added DocC documentation hosting to the <a href="https://cur.at/Py2EiFW?m=rss">Swift Package Index</a>, I was very happy with what we built and how easy it was for package authors to opt in to. But I also hoped that people might spend more time writing documentation if building and hosting it were only a matter of <a href="https://cur.at/9ya6EwY?m=rss">adding a couple of lines of YML in a configuration file</a>.</p>

<p>I’m delighted to say that it’s becoming clear that my hope is coming true as this week as we hit a milestone of 500 packages choosing to have us build and host their documentation. 🎉 As a percentage, that’s almost 8% of the 6,300+ packages we index. Given that DocC has only been available for a little over two years and our documentation hosting for a little over a year, I’m pleased with how high that number is.</p>

<p>However, a more interesting number appears when you filter that by packages added to the index since we launched our DocC hosting feature. With that filter, the number rises to almost 18%! Even better, that percentage is rising over time. 📈</p>

<p>So, I thought I’d use today’s comment as a reminder that if you contribute to an open-source Swift package, <a href="https://cur.at/9ya6EwY?m=rss">the Swift Package Index can build and host documentation for free</a>. I’d love to look at that number in a few months and see it rise even further.</p>

<blockquote><p>Getting Xcode to show you the places in your project which use a particular method, function or variable has long been hidden one layer deep in the context menu</p></blockquote>

<p>I’ll take that statement and raise it. I’ve long wished Xcode had this functionality, and <em>had no idea it was available</em> in any version of Xcode until now! 😱</p>

        <p>I liked this very pragmatic advice from <a href="https://cur.at/wrpBv9?m=rss">Alejandro Martinez</a> as he considers SwiftUI version compatibility:</p>

<blockquote><p>Remember that this code is for you. It’s likely that you are not trying to make a full featured framework for the entire world, so if you don’t need some functionality right now, just skip it. By the time you need it, you will use the native solution already.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s great to release packages that others can use, but it’s always worth remembering that you don’t <em>have</em> to.</p>

        <![CDATA[      <h3>Comment</h3>
      
        <h4></h4>
        <p>During the <a href="https://cur.at/Oht0j5C?m=rss">Meet Push Notifications Console</a> session at this year’s WWDC, you may have seen that Apple added logging functionality to the <a href="https://cur.at/me9rPkF?m=rss">Notifications dashboard</a> in your developer account.</p>

<p>This feature is huge if your app sends pushes, and what app doesn’t these days? For a long time, push notifications were very much something you posted into the void with your fingers crossed that they would end up pinging a device somewhere. It feels like delivery rates are much better than they used to be when they first launched, but it’s just that, a feeling based on anecdotal data.</p>

<p>It’s now possible to figure out what’s happening with notification delivery. Store the new <code>apns-unique-id</code> identifier that comes back with the payload from sending a notification, and use the new <a href="https://cur.at/me9rPkF?m=rss">Delivery Log</a> to investigate what happened during delivery.</p>

<p>That’s incredibly useful for individual messages but not so much for overall statistics. The good news is that the other half of the story <a href="https://cur.at/zaJReVO?m=rss">arrived this week</a> with the addition of aggregated metrics. You can now see a breakdown of delivery by notification type (alerts, complication updates, live activities, etc.) and see how many messages APNS delivered, stored for later, or discarded, along with information about <em>why</em> they ended in that state. It’s handy information, and you should give it a look for your apps!</p>

<p>We’ve <a href="https://cur.at/i0J2pqB?m=rss">come a long way from how notifications launched in iOS 3</a>!</p>

      <h3>News</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/cf6I6mt?m=rss">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS 17</a></h4>
        <p>It’s that time of year again! <a href="https://cur.at/aXmLNk6?m=rss">Alexandre Colucci’s</a> annual look at Swift and SwiftUI adoption inside this year’s iOS release. I’ll let you review all the stats by reading the post, but it’s worth calling out that exponential curve for SwiftUI adoption. Look at it go!🚀</p>

<p>That said, for anyone thinking that Objective-C is going <em>anywhere</em> any time soon, the fact that 61% of binaries in this release still depend on it tells a story.</p>

      <h3>Tools</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/gm8RYRR?m=rss">Apparency</a></h4>
        <p>I’ve had this installed for a while now, but I didn’t link to it yet for some reason, so when <a href="https://cur.at/srinzjc?m=rss">I saw this post from Craig Hockenberry</a>, it was a good reminder to fix that oversight. It’s a great little app, and you’ll probably find it useful. 👍</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/GqFJAiX?m=rss">Introducing Insights</a></h4>
        <p><a href="https://cur.at/vR2cPyM?m=rss">Reveal</a> has some big news for their app and a significant step forward for proactive accessibility testing. I think the key point from their announcement is this:</p>

<blockquote><p>This new functionality takes Reveal from a passive developer tool, where you need to know what to look for in order to identify issues, to one that proactively surfaces problems along with suggestions on how to fix them.</p></blockquote>

<p>It’s also worth watching <a href="https://cur.at/WGM132P?m=rss">Tony Arnold</a> &amp; <a href="https://cur.at/1KKIEWw?m=rss">Chris Kolbu</a> at the <code>/dev/world/23</code> conference to see it in action. I also love how the app accompanies every recommendation with references to the WCAG or Apple’s HIG.</p>

<p>For full disclosure, Itty Bitty Apps, the creators of Reveal, have previously sponsored this newsletter.</p>

      <h3>Code</h3>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/wMAti0n?m=rss">Being a good citizen in the land of SwiftSyntax</a></h4>
        <p>If you use Swift 5.9’s macros, you’ll want to read this post from <a href="https://cur.at/814CcJX?m=rss">Brandon Williams</a> and <a href="https://cur.at/OxuJpLO?m=rss">Stephen Celis</a>. It all started with a <a href="https://cur.at/JMSWRmX?m=rss">forum post</a>, which provides some interesting background.</p>

<p>There’s a <a href="https://cur.at/RVYVh4E?m=rss">bundled version of the library</a>, but it’s undocumented, so you probably shouldn’t rely on it. I’m nowhere near qualified to comment on the pros and cons of bundling an official/supported version, but I’m sure the Swift team have discussed it. Until then, this advice on managing the <a href="https://cur.at/NaKXywY?m=rss">SwiftSyntax</a> dependency is worth reading.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/j3T7Jrw?m=rss">SwiftSyntax Code Generation Notes</a></h4>
        <p>Talking of SwiftSyntax, <a href="https://cur.at/nDgxIww?m=rss">Pádraig Ó Cinnéide</a> also has some more good advice on taming it.</p>
          <p><a href="https://cur.at/j3T7Jrw?m=rss">padraig.org</a></p>
      
        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/E5VH6lD?m=rss">Switching Build Systems, Seamlessly</a></h4>
        <p>Before you read this post from <a href="https://cur.at/wbMNCn4?m=rss">Patrick Balestra</a>, it’s worth remembering that when you get to the end, and that little thought pops into your head, “Hey, maybe I should do this!” there’s a 99.9% chance you don’t need to and shouldn’t. 😂 It’s still interesting to read about, though. 👍</p>

        <h4><a href="https://cur.at/vJ7TM4z?m=rss">Mastering Preview macro in Swift</a></h4>
        <p>Sure, you can put a single <code>#Preview</code> under your view code and be done with it, but did you see what else you can do with that macro? <a href="https://cur.at/V3rHuJW?m=rss">Majid Jabrayilov</a> is here to show us.</p>
